# Price-Optimization

**Objective:**
The objective of price optimization is typically to maximize the expected net contributions from sales.

**Constraints:**
Capacity or Inventory: There may be physical limitations on the capacity or inventory of the supermarket chain.
Business or Marketing Rules: These could include brand guidelines, pricing strategies, or profit margins.
Legal Limitations: This may involve pricing regulations or antitrust laws.

**What:**
The focus is on ketchup sales, which could involve determining the optimal pricing strategy for Heinz, Huntâ€™s, and Del Monte ketchup products.

**Where:**
The market is Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which may have specific demographic characteristics, competition, and consumer preferences that influence pricing decisions.

**Who:**
The products are offered by the Hy-Vee supermarket chain, targeting consumers in the Sioux Falls area.

**Marketing Variables:**
Regular Price: The standard price of the ketchup products.
Price Cut: Any promotional discounts or price reductions.
Feature: Whether the product is featured prominently in marketing materials or advertisements.
Display: The visibility and placement of the product in-store, such as end-cap displays or aisle displays.

**Approach:**
To optimize prices, conduct regression analysis to model the relationship between sales and marketing variables. We can then use optimization algorithms to find the price points that maximize expected net contributions while adhering to constraints.
